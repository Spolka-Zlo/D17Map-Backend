# 🔵 D17Map - Backend Side 🗺 🔍


## 🔷 How to run?
### 🔹 Setup
Before running any of the following commands, you should create a `.env` file
in the same directory as `docker-compose.yaml`. The `.env` file should
contain your password to the database:


#### .env
```text
PASSWORD=<your_password>
```


### 🔹 Commands
The following commands should be issued from the root directory of the project.

1. `docker compose build`
2. `docker compose up -d`


## 🔷 Cleaning Docker
Sometimes docker has problems with itself, but there is a couple of commands which you can try to fix it

1. `docker compose down` - this command stops containers and removes them.
2. `docker system prune` - removes all dangling/untagged resources
3. `docker system prune -a` - removes a little bit more ;)
4. `docker volume rm <your volume name>` - obvious (use `docker volume ls` to list all volumes)
5. `docker volume prune` - removes all dangling volumes

## Testing for future

```kotlin
package com.example

import io.ktor.client.request.*
import io.ktor.client.statement.*
import io.ktor.http.*
import io.ktor.server.testing.*
import kotlin.test.*

class OrderRouteTests {
    @Test
    fun testGetOrder() = testApplication {
        val response = client.get("/order/2020-04-06-01")
        assertEquals(
            """{"number":"2020-04-06-01","contents":[{"item":"Ham Sandwich","amount":2,"price":5.5},{"item":"Water","amount":1,"price":1.5},{"item":"Beer","amount":3,"price":2.3},{"item":"Cheesecake","amount":1,"price":3.75}]}""",
            response.bodyAsText()
        )
        assertEquals(HttpStatusCode.OK, response.status)
    }
}
```



## Object model

![Object Model](docs/object_model.png)



## Problems / TODO

- [ ] Fixing model / how to save object with a reference to other object
- [ ] Adjusting DAO layer
- [ ] Fix mappings
- [ ] Introduce exceptions to service layer
- [ ] Introduce status pages / exception handling in controller layer



# TODO new

- [ ] Either do it in service and DTO or change a model (I think it'd be better) so a reservation has date, startTime, endTIme
- [ ] GET all classrooms (without description)
- [ ] GET all reservations (without owner), (with type, start, end, classroom)
- [ ] GET all your reservations
- [ ] GET all reservations by date
- [ ] POST new reservation
- [ ] GET /rooms (but Radek says with name... is name and description not the same here?)
- [ ] GET /dayReservations
- change equipment (hashmap)
